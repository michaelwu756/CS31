In step 5, I entered the following sequence of integers: 100, 100, 100.
The following output occured:

How many registered voters were surveyed? 100
How many of them say they will vote for Hillary? 100
How many of them say they will vote for Donald? 100

100.0% say they will vote for Hillary.
100.0% say they will vote for Donald.
Donald is predicted to win the election.

This output is nonsensical because everybody says they will vote for Hillary and Trump at the same time,
which cannot happen. Also, Trump is still predicted to win even though both percentages are the same.

In step 6, the logic error I introduced was switching the order the variables forHillary and forDonald
were read in, on lines 16 and 18. This causes the percentages to be recorded wrong and switched. For
reasonable input, the program will predict the wrong candidate to win.

In step 7, the two compile errors I introduced were deleting the declaration of the forDonald variable,
and leaving a semicolon off of line 25. This lead to an error saying that "'forDonald' was not declared
in this scope", and an error saying "expected ';' before 'cout'", respectively.
