Obstacles
An obstacle that I overcame was trying to implement the different tiers of revenues. I had to identify each
revenue bracket using if statements. I also had to implement the different rate for buildings in UAE and Turkey.
I solved this by creating a variable fee rate that would change if the country string was UAE or Turkey.

Test Data
The test data will be it the form
description("building",revenue,"country")

No building ID ("",10,"USA")
Revenue is negative ("The Tower",-10,"USA")
No country ("The Tower",10,"")
Revenue is a double ("The Tower",0.5,"USA")
Revenue is below 20 million ("The Tower",10,"USA")
Revenue is 20 million ("The Tower",20,"USA")
Revenue is between 20 million and 50 million not in UAE or Turkey ("The Tower",30,"USA")
Revenue is between 20 million and 50 million in UAE or Turkey ("The Tower",30,"UAE")
Revenue is 50 million not in UAE or Turkey ("The Tower",50,"USA")
Revenue is 50 million in UAE or Turkey ("The Tower",50,"UAE")
Revenue is greater than 50 million not in UAE or Turkey ("The Tower",60,"USA")
Revenue is greater than 50 million in UAE or Turkey ("The Tower",60,"USA")

My program handles all of these test cases correctly.
