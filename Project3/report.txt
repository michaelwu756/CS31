Obstacles
The most notable obstacle I overcame was trying to come up with a way to parse the data in the hasCorrectSyntax function. I
overcame this by having two modes of reading in data, one to read in the state code and another to read in the state forecast.
Other than that, the rest of the project was fairly straightforward.

Design
The hasCorrectSyntax function works as follows

while polldata still has remaining characters
{
	clear recorded state code, number, party, and mode
	while polldata still has remaining characters or mode is less than 2
	{
		if mode is 0
		{
			add character to state code
			if state code has 2 characters
				increase mode
		}
		else if mode is 1
		{
			if character is a digit
				add character to number string
			else
			{
				add character to party
				increase mode
			}
		}
	}
	if state code, number string, or party is invalid
		return false
}
return true

The count votes function works as follows

Convert party and poll string to upper case
If poll string is not valid
	return 1
If poll string has 0 as electoral votes
	return 2
If party is not a letter
	return 3
loop through each character of poll data string
{
	if character is a digit
		record it
	else
	{
		if the recorded digits are not empty and the character matches the party
			add value of recorded digits to vote count
		clear recorded digits
	}
}

The predictsZeroVotes function simply checks if there is a string of zeros in the polldata string and returns true if it exists.
The isValidNumber function checks if a string is a number that has 1 or 2 digits.
The strToUpper function converts a string to uppercase character by character.

Test Cases
(hasCorrectSyntax("")==true)//empty string
(hasCorrectSyntax("AL1DAK1DAZ1DAR1DCA1DCO1DCT1DDE1DDC1DFL1DGA1DHI1DID1DIL1DIN1DIA1DKS1DKY1DLA1DME1DMD1DMA1DMI1DMN1DMS1DMO1DMT1DNE1DNV1DNH1DNJ1DNM1DNY1DNC1DND1DOH1DOK1DOR1DPA1DRI1DSC1DSD1DTN1DTX1DUT1DVT1DVA1DWA1DWV1DWI1DWY1D")==true)//every state code test	
(hasCorrectSyntax(" ")==false)//non alphanumeric character
(hasCorrectSyntax("NJ39")==false)//missing party
(hasCorrectSyntax("39D")==false)//missing state
(hasCorrectSyntax("XY33B")==false)//invalid state code
(hasCorrectSyntax("NJD")==false)//missing electoral vote number
(hasCorrectSyntax("NJ999D")==false)//number must have 1 or 2 digits
(hasCorrectSyntax("NJ1D")==true)//1 digit
(hasCorrectSyntax("NJ11D")==true)//2 digits
(hasCorrectSyntax("nj1d")==true)//lowercase

(countVotes("TX38RCA 5D", 'd', votes)==1)//incorrect syntax
(countVotes("TX38RCA00D", 'd', votes)==2)//state with zero votes
(countVotes("TX38RCA01D", ' ', votes)==3)//invalid party
(countVotes("TX38RCA01D", 'd', votes)==0 && votes==1)//checks votes correctly
